Below is a summary of how NeoCode is designed to give you a VS Code‑like terminal experience and what changes to make so that the LazyVim dashboard appears as a normal tab rather than overlaying your layout.

1. How NeoCode (LazyVim + tmux) mimics VS Code

NeoCode glues tmux and Neovim/LazyVim together. Each tmux window corresponds to a VS Code “workspace”, while Neovim buffers act as file tabs. The key ideas from the project documentation are:

Single file‑tree – you should have only one neo‑tree panel that is shared across all buffers, instead of multiple explorers opening for every file
github.com
.

Buffers shown as tabs – open files are displayed in the bufferline at the top, and you can switch between them with Ctrl+Tab or number shortcuts
github.com
.

Dashboard as buffer – the LazyVim dashboard should not overlay your editor; it should open in a buffer that can be closed like any file
github.com
.

tmux panes for panels – the left pane hosts neo‑tree (file explorer), the centre is your code area, and bottom/right panes can be terminals or git views, just like VS Code’s “terminal” and “source control” panels
github.com
.

2. Setting up the VS Code‑like layout

Copy the NeoCode configuration.
Copy config/nvim-neocode.lua from the repo to ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/neocode.lua as described in the LazyVim Setup Guide
github.com
.

Add a plugin configuration file.
Create ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/neocode.lua and return a table configuring Bufferline and neo‑tree and disabling the dashboard on startup. The documentation provides a ready‑to‑use example
github.com
; this ensures:

bufferline.nvim shows buffers as tabs (VS Code‑style).

neo-tree.nvim opens as the only file explorer (in the left pane).

alpha-nvim (or LazyVim’s default dashboard) is disabled on startup to avoid overlay.

Initialize the configuration on start‑up.
Add an autocommand in your LazyVim init.lua (or ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua) to run require('config.neocode').setup() on VimEnter
github.com
. This loads your custom keymaps, UI settings and dashboard command.

Update your tmux configuration.
Use the provided config/tmux.conf or append its contents to ~/.tmux.conf
github.com
. It remaps the prefix to Ctrl+A and enables smooth navigation between Neovim splits and tmux panes (Ctrl+H/J/K/L). Running scripts/neocode-lazyvim creates the layout: neo‑tree on the left, code in the centre, and a bottom terminal; if the project is a git repo a git status pane appears
github.com
.

Restart Neovim / tmux.
After copying these files, reload your tmux (tmux source ~/.tmux.conf) and restart Neovim to see the changes
github.com
.

3. Fixing the dashboard overlay issue

The default LazyVim “snacks” or Alpha dashboard opens automatically when Vim starts. This is why your file tree and open files are hidden behind the start screen in your screenshot. To make the dashboard behave like a normal tab:

Disable the auto‑open on startup. In config/nvim-neocode.lua, NeoCode already sets vim.g.dashboard_disable_at_vimenter = 1
github.com
. Ensure this line is present; it prevents the dashboard from popping up automatically.

Provide a command to open the dashboard manually. The same file defines a :Dashboard command that runs require('alpha').start(true)
github.com
. The keymap <leader>ud is mapped to :Dashboard<CR> so you can open the dashboard in the current buffer
github.com
. You can close it with Ctrl+W just like any buffer.

Ensure the plugin is configured to respect this behaviour. In your plugins/neocode.lua, add the section that sets optional = true and returns the existing dashboard config while still disabling auto‑open
github.com
. This stops LazyVim’s default loader from forcing the dashboard to appear.

After making these changes, your start screen will no longer overlay the editor; instead, you can open it whenever you like (e.g., via <Space> + ud), and it will appear as a normal buffer tab that can be closed.

4. Navigating the VS Code‑like interface

Toggle the file explorer with Ctrl + B or Ctrl + Shift + E
github.com
. Neo-tree will open in the left pane and remain there.

Open files using Ctrl + P or Space + ff (Telescope). Each file opens in its own buffer and appears as a tab in the bufferline
github.com
.

Switch between files (buffers) with Ctrl + Tab/Ctrl + Shift + Tab or by pressing Space + 1..9 to jump directly to a tab
github.com
.

Navigate between tmux panes and Neovim splits with Ctrl + H/J/K/L (enabled via vim-tmux-navigator)
github.com
; use the tmux prefix (Ctrl + A) then | or - to create new vertical or horizontal splits
github.com
.

Summary

NeoCode already contains the building blocks to give you a VS Code‑like layout. Copy its Neovim configuration and plugin definitions into your LazyVim setup, disable the dashboard’s auto‑open, and use tmux to arrange the panes. After these steps, you will have:

A single Neo‑tree explorer on the left.

A central editing area with multiple buffer tabs.

Optional bottom/right panes for terminals or git.

A dashboard that opens as a normal buffer via <Space> + ud and can be closed like any other file.

With these tweaks, your terminal environment should feel much closer to VS Code while retaining the power and speed of Neovim and tmux.



NeoCode VS Code‑like Terminal Editor Setup
Introduction

NeoCode uses LazyVim (a modern Neovim distribution) together with tmux to provide a terminal‑based development environment reminiscent of Visual Studio Code. It keeps a single file tree in the left pane, shows open files as tabs via Bufferline at the top, and arranges terminals and git views in bottom/right panels
github.com
. This document explains how to configure NeoCode and disable the dashboard overlay so that the start screen opens as a normal buffer.

Quick Setup

Copy the NeoCode configuration file. Copy nvim‑neocode.lua from the repository into your LazyVim setup
github.com
. Place it at ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/neocode.lua.

Create a plugin configuration file. Create ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/neocode.lua and configure Bufferline and the neo‑tree file explorer. This file should also disable the dashboard on startup
github.com
.

Add an autocommand. In your init.lua or autocmds.lua, add an autocommand that calls require("config.neocode").setup() on VimEnter
. This loads keymaps, sets UI options and defines the :Dashboard command.

Update tmux configuration. Copy the NeoCode tmux configuration into ~/.tmux.conf and reload tmux

.

Restart and launch. Restart Neovim and run scripts/neocode-lazyvim start to launch the environment. The script automatically opens Neovim with a file explorer, splits a terminal pane and adds a git pane when in a repository
github.com
.

Architecture and Key Concepts

NeoCode’s layout is built around the following concepts
github.com
:

tmux windows behave like VS Code “workspaces” — each window can host a separate project or task.

Neovim buffers are used for files; they appear in the Bufferline tab bar at the top.

A single neo‑tree file explorer lives in the left pane and is shared across all buffers, avoiding duplicated file trees.
github.com

tmux panes provide separate panels for the editor, integrated terminal and optional git view.

Plugin Configuration

Your plugin configuration file (plugins/neocode.lua) should:

Configure Bufferline to display buffers instead of Neovim tabs and align them with the file explorer offset
github.com
.

Configure neo‑tree so there is only one file explorer anchored to the left. Use window.position = "left" and enable file operations such as opening, splitting and refreshing
github.com
.

Disable the default dashboard. Set vim.g.dashboard_disable_at_vimenter = 1 so LazyVim’s dashboard does not open automatically
github.com
. The dashboard can still be opened manually using the :Dashboard command defined in your NeoCode configuration
github.com
.

Initializing NeoCode

Add the following autocommand in your LazyVim configuration:

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("VimEnter", {
  callback = function()
    require("config.neocode").setup()
  end,
})


This loads NeoCode’s UI and keymaps on startup
github.com
. Keymaps include familiar shortcuts such as Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+Tab to cycle through files, Ctrl+B to toggle the explorer and Ctrl+H/J/K/L to move between tmux and Neovim panes
github.com
.

tmux Configuration and Sessions

NeoCode provides a tmux configuration that remaps the prefix to Ctrl+A and includes pane navigation bindings
github.com
. Append this configuration to ~/.tmux.conf or copy it directly
github.com
, then reload tmux (tmux source ~/.tmux.conf). To launch NeoCode, run the scripts/neocode-lazyvim script. It starts a tmux session, opens Neovim in the project directory with neo‑tree visible, splits a bottom terminal pane and optionally adds a git status pane when inside a git repository
github.com
.

Navigation Tips

Toggle the file explorer with Ctrl + B or Ctrl + Shift + E
github.com
.

Open files via Telescope using Ctrl + P or Space + ff; each file opens in its own buffer and appears in the Bufferline
github.com
.

Switch between buffers with Ctrl + Tab, Ctrl + Shift + Tab or by pressing Space + 1..9
github.com
.

Navigate between panes (tmux and Neovim) with Ctrl + H/J/K/L
github.com
.

Open the dashboard as a normal buffer by pressing Space + ud or running :Dashboard
github.com
. Close it like any file with Ctrl + W.

Customization and Troubleshooting

Adjust file tree width or Bufferline appearance by modifying the window.width property in your neo‑tree configuration or changing tab_size and max_name_length in the Bufferline options
github.com
.

If the dashboard overlays the editor, ensure vim.g.dashboard_disable_at_vimenter = 1 is set
github.com
 and that you open the dashboard manually with :Dashboard
github.com
.

If the file tree appears in multiple panes, close all instances with :bufdo bd and reopen it once using Ctrl + B
github.com
.

If shortcuts aren’t working, verify you are in Normal mode (press Esc) and that your custom keymaps are loaded
github.com
.
